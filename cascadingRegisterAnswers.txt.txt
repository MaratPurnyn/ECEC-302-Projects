“A process updates signals when it finishes interpreting the statements all the way to 
the end process statement, it then goes back to suspend at begin statement, waiting 
on sensitivity list signal events.”
What is the sensitive signal(s) in my_reg process? What about in the previous 
tutorials?

the sensitive signal is the clock. in previous tutorials it was the enable switch.

a) temp1 (z1 LEDs) should get new input vector x and temp2 (z2 LEDs) gets old temp1 
when en button pressed, but it doesn’t do that, does it?
No


b) Do both new Z1 and Z2 equal to X when en button pressed?
Yes


c) What is the bug (erroneous from design specification)?
Temp2 and Temp1 are the same so Z1 and Z2 are the same. This is because the assignments are interpreted concurrently.


d) A Solution: Include the ability to single-step the clock that synchs the 
hardware-under-test. This solution can provide a useful debugging utility. Below is 
new cascading registers with A, B buttons and a module Step providing single-step 
clock signal CK1 syncing the registers. The load enable port EN is now a switch.
